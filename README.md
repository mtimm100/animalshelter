# animalshelter
Background: Every year, animal shelters across the U.S. give approximately 7.6 million animals a chance at finding a forever home and starting a new life (ASPCA 2016). Some of these animals are adopted or  reunited with their owners, while many others face less desirable fates. Certain traits in animals may affect their outcomes at shelters, and knowing which characteristics have the most significance would allow shelters to focus their efforts on the animals who may have a lower chance of getting adopted. 

Goal: Develop a system that will utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the outcomes of animals brought to a shelter as well as gain insight into which characteristics carry the most weight in determining their outcomes.
